Files for the code challenge.

The index file is the HTML file for the code challenge, the JS file creates HTML elements dynamically depending on the JSON file
that has been stored in an array for easier manipulation.

The style.less file contains all the styling for the code challenge which then compiles to the styles.css file.

The JS file is used to add the functionalities for the code challenge.

All the acceptance criteria have been met and the code is working as per the needs of the user defined in the scope document.

Cheers!
